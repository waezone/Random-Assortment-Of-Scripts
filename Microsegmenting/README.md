A simple AHK script for quickly switching between segments for segmented speedruns of source games.

Allows for very fast route development, theory crafting, and most of all, a really optimized speedrun.

## How to use

Download both microsegmentingv2.ahk and seg.cfg and put them in your game directory's cfg folder.

Create 2 folders, one in the SAVE folder and one in the game directory with the same name, edit microsegmentingv2.ahk and change "folder\" next to DemoPath to what you named your folders, keeping the backslash

In seg.cfg replace every instance of the same folder name to the same name. After this just change the binds and sensitivity to what you are used to.

Lastly, ingame bind KP_INS to "exec seg.cfg", the script will press this button automatically when you change segment, and thats it, you should be good to go.

For controls, left bracket to go back and right bracket to go to next.
