A simple AHK script for quickly switching between segments for segmented speedruns of source games.

Allows for very fast route development, theory crafting, and most of all, a really optimized speedrun.

## How to use

Be sure to have Auto Hotkey installed, and download this folder.

Open the script by opening the Microsegmenting.ahk file and then fill out all the settings

First Select the game path such as C:\Users\waezo\Desktop\Half-Life\New Engine\hl2 so it knows where to place or read the folders

The binds are self explanitory but the binds on the lower half need to be the bind names you would use ingame

Current Segment is the save and demo number you will create when you press the stop segment bind, they will be autoformatted just without the time

Demos will appear in the Run Name folder, same with saves but nested in the SAVE folder

Sensitivity is set to zero until you unpause, so you will need to input your sensitivity in the sensitivity box for it to reset to

Username is the name used in the formatting of the demo and saves

Lastly, a really important step is to set the reload cfg bind and then set the corresponding key in game, every time you select a segment it will reload the cfg file with the new segment

## Note

Microsegmenting is a fast and easy way to make segments, but it can easily be destructive, every time you go to a new segment and start recording, you will overwrite the demo of that segment so be sure to save your demos and saves often.
